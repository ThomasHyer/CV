<h3><em>Whats Going on?</em></h3>
<p>This club is all it says it is, chess, chess is a stratigy game where you try to use your units to take out the other
players units. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king, a checkmate occurs when you put the king in check
(meaning the king in question is able to be killed by another troop although the king can't die.) the players who's king
is in check has to either move the king, kill the troop threatening the king, or block the troop using another troop.
if you can't do any of these things then its called a checkmate and the game is over. Both players have the same
 troops and number of them so may the best tactician win.</p>
